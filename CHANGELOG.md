## [0.2.5] - 2026-08-09

- TAG: [v0.2.5][0.2.5t]
- COVERAGE: 95.13% -- 527/554 lines in 13 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 83.25% -- 164/197 branches in 13 files
- 79.73% documented

### Changed

- kettle-jem-template-20260801-001 - Generated README gem dashboard links now
  use ClickGems instead of BestGems.

### Fixed

- kettle-jem-template-20260801-002 - Generated RSpec helpers now normalize
  managed configuration block bindings structurally, preventing mixed block
  parameter names from producing invalid configuration after a merge.
- kettle-jem-template-20260801-003 - Generated project metadata and
  documentation now normalize configured underscore hostnames to valid
  hyphenated hostnames.
- kettle-jem-template-20260801-004 - Generated organization README logos now
  use GitHub's stable organization avatar endpoint instead of assuming a
  matching Galtzo-hosted asset exists.
- kettle-jem-template-20260802-001 - Devcontainer JSON files now merge as JSONC,
  preserving comments and trailing commas during template updates.

- Load the version namespace from the public yard/yaml entrypoint

## [0.2.4] - 2026-07-31

- TAG: [v0.2.4][0.2.4t]
- COVERAGE: 94.36% -- 519/550 lines in 13 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 83.25% -- 164/197 branches in 13 files
- 79.73% documented

### Added

- Documentation linting now has its generated `yard-lint` dependency and severity config available in the local bundle.

- kettle-jem-template-20260726-001 - Projects now include YARD lint
  configuration and documentation dependencies so documentation issues fail
  before generated docs are refreshed.

- kettle-jem-template-20260727-001 - Spec harness documentation now lists the
  RSpec helpers provided by `kettle-test`.

### Changed

- kettle-jem-template-20260716-002 - Generated gemspec manifests now ship fewer
  repository-only files by default to reduce downstream distro packaging churn.
- kettle-jem-template-20260720-002 - Generated development Gemfiles now use the
  released `tree_sitter_language_pack` gem 1.13.3 or newer by default.
- kettle-jem-template-20260720-003 - Generated StructuredMerge Git diff driver
  config now uses the installed `smorg-rb` Ruby driver name.
- kettle-jem-template-20260720-005 - Generated README Support & Community rows
  now include a RubyForum help badge.
- kettle-jem-template-20260725-001 - Generated JRuby and TruffleRuby workflow
  files now run when pull request head branches start with `feature/release`,
  so release CI monitoring does not report intentionally skipped engine
  workflows as failures.

- kettle-jem-template-20260725-002 - Generated gemspec templates now include
  `anonymous_loader` as a development dependency, and version specs use it to
  execute generated `version.rb` files for coverage without redefining package
  constants. Managed version specs are removed when `version_gem` is disabled
  or incompatible with the project's runtime Ruby floor.

- kettle-jem-template-20260728-001 - Generated Ruby workflows now use clearer
  setup-ruby-flash planning and can prepare appraisal-only jobs without
  installing the main Gemfile bundle.

### Fixed

- kettle-jem-template-20260726-002 - Generated version files now document their
  version namespace and constants, reducing warning-only YARD lint output.

- kettle-jem-template-20260726-003 - Coverage upload steps now treat Coveralls,
  QLTY, and Codecov as optional, so provider outages do not fail CI when local
  coverage thresholds still pass.
- kettle-jem-template-20260728-002 - Generated RuboCop configs now ignore the
  same `gemfiles/vendor/bundle` tree as `.gitignore`, so vendored dependency
  installs are not reported as project lint debt.
- kettle-jem-template-20260728-003 - Generated dep-heads workflows now run
  TruffleRuby jobs with current RubyGems and Bundler, avoiding setup failures
  before the test suite starts.

- kettle-jem-template-20260728-004 - Generated dep-heads workflows now use the
  setup-ruby Bundler install path for direct appraisal Gemfiles, avoiding rv
  lockfile parser failures on Git and path dependencies.

- kettle-jem-template-20260728-005 - VersionGem bootstrap now creates the
  missing canonical version spec when a project only has shim namespace version
  specs.

- kettle-jem-template-20260730-001 - Gemspec package file enumeration now runs
  relative to the gemspec directory, so packaged template assets are included
  even when the gemspec is loaded from another working directory.

- RDoc framework appraisals no longer install current-Ruby documentation tools,
  keeping their dependency set scoped to the RDoc compatibility axis.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-14

- TAG: [v0.2.1][0.2.1t]
- COVERAGE: 94.88% -- 519/547 lines in 12 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 83.25% -- 164/197 branches in 12 files
- 78.38% documented

### Fixed

- Restored `docs/CNAME` so the generated documentation site keeps its custom domain.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-03

- TAG: [v0.2.0][0.2.0t]
- COVERAGE: 94.88% -- 519/547 lines in 12 files

- 78.38% documented

### Changed

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-27

- TAG: [v0.1.3][0.1.3t]
- COVERAGE: 94.88% -- 519/547 lines in 12 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 83.25% -- 164/197 branches in 12 files
- 78.38% documented

### Fixed

- YAML documentation pages no longer truncate long source lines by default,
  preserving full values such as repository URLs in rendered CFF pages.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-27

- TAG: [v0.1.2][0.1.2t]
- COVERAGE: 94.88% -- 519/547 lines in 12 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 83.25% -- 164/197 branches in 12 files
- 78.38% documented

### Changed

- Documented that `yard-yaml` discovers YAML/CFF files through its own globs
  and that listing those files as plain YARD inputs is only needed when users
  intentionally want YARD's raw file-page rendering too.

### Fixed

- Converted YAML page filenames now default to source paths instead of YAML
  titles, keeping display titles separate from stable output paths and avoiding
  silent overwrites when titles collide.
- Expanded plugin, logger, registry, and tag-renderer specs so the test suite
  again satisfies the configured line and branch coverage gates.
- `--plugin yaml` now activates discovery and emits converted YAML pages after
  YARD finishes generating HTML.
- `Yard::Yaml::Converter` now adapts to `yaml-converter`'s real in-memory
  Markdown API instead of calling an obsolete positional `convert` signature.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-24

- TAG: [v0.1.1][0.1.1t]
- COVERAGE: 92.61% -- 451/487 lines in 12 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.88% -- 133/173 branches in 12 files
- 77.46% documented

### Added

- `documentation_local.gemfile` support for sibling-workspace documentation development under `KETTLE_DEV_DEV`
- Added generated CI coverage for `rdoc` `~> 6.11` and `>= 7.0`.

### Changed

- Refreshed generated project tooling, CI, and documentation support from the current `kettle-jem` template.

### Fixed

- `Yard::Yaml::Converter.from_file` now preserves valid UTF-8 text, scrubs malformed UTF-8 safely in non-strict mode, and rejects binary-ish inputs without raw encoding crashes

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-10

- TAG: [v0.1.0][0.1.0t]
- COVERAGE: 91.13% -- 421/462 lines in 12 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 75.47% -- 120/159 branches in 12 files
- 84.38% documented
